# Customer-Managed Key (CMK)

Customer-Managed Key (CMK) or Bring your own key (BYOK) allows customers to configure customer-managed keys for Azure Container Registry (ACR) encryption. All customer-managed keys must be stored in an Azure Key Vault.

In this version of the API, you can create a new Premium container registry with CMK can be enabled using an Azure ARM template. 

> **Note:** The  CLI  and portal experience will light up soon.

### Current limitations

* Disabling encryption for a registry is not supported.
* Other registry features like geo-replication, content-trust and VNet integration will also be supported in a future release
* This feature is only enabled on a newly created registry

## Whitelist your subscription to use the feature

At this time, you must request access to use this capability. To do so, please contact acrsup@microsoft.com and provide the subscription id.
After approved, you can use https://aka.ms/acr/portal/preview/cmk to view the encryption setting in portal

## Deploy a registry with CMK enabled

Follow these steps to create a registry with CMK enabled using an ARM template. Note that we will create a Key Vault and Key using CLI as we do not have ARM support for these scenarios.

### 1. Create a resource group

Create a resource group for creating the Key Vault and Keys.

```bash
az group create -g <resource-group-name> -l <location>
```

### 2. Create a key vault

Create a key vault to store customer-managed keys for registry encryption. This key vault should have two key protection settings enabled - Soft Delete and Do Not Purge. 

```bash
az keyvault create â€“-name <key-vault-name> -g <resource-group-name> --enable-soft-delete --enable-purge-protection
```

### 3. Create a key and get the key ID

Create a key and get the full key ID. 
> **Note:** if you skip the step because you have an existing key, make sure use a full key ID with version

```bash
 KEK=$(az keyvault key create --name <key-name> --vault-name <key-vault-name> --query key.kid -o tsv)
 ```

### 4. Create a registry with CMK enabled

Download the [template.json file](https://github.com/Azure/acr/blob/master/docs/CMK/template.json). Run the following command to create a registry with CMK enabled. Note that you need to provide the key vault name that you just created. Registry and user assigned managed identity will be created by the template.

```bash
az group deployment create -g <resource-group-name> --template-file <template.json> --parameters vault_name=<key-vault-name> registry_name=<registry-name> identity_name=<managed-identity> kek_id=$KEK
```

### 5. Key rotation

You can rotate keys by creating a new key using step 3 and then using the new key in step 4 mentioned above.

### 6. View registry encryption settings

```bash
az resource show --id <registry-resource-id> --query properties.encryption --api-version 2019-12-01-preview
```

## Login and use the registry

### 1. Login to your registry

```json
az acr login -n myacr
```

Follow [this documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-registry/container-registry-authentication) for authenticate your docker client to your container registry.

### 2. Push images to your registry

For pushing docker images on your registry, follow [this documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-registry/container-registry-get-started-docker-cli)
