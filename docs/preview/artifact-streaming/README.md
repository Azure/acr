## About

Azure Container Registry (ACR) and Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) is proud to announce the public preview for artifact streaming. Artifact streaming for AKS provides customers the ability to accelerate containerized workloads in the cloud by dramatically reducing the overall startup time.

Artifact streaming will empower customers to scale resources on AKS seamlessly by not having to wait for long pull times for each Kubernetes pod. Customers with Linux amd64 container images are supported during this public preview and have plans to support Windows and arm64 container images in the future. We canâ€™t wait to hear what our customers have to think and look forward to hearing feedback on further improving this feature. 

Portal and CLI documentation will be available on Tuesday, November 14, 2023.
