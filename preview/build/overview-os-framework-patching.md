Addition of Lifecycle Management â€“ OS & Framework Patching
As containers provide new levels of virtualization, enabling application and developer dependencies to be isolated from the infrastructure and operational requirements, we must address how the application virtualization is patched. Azure Container Registry launches a native container build service, enabling inner-loop development in the cloud and automated builds from git commits to base image updates. With base image update triggers, customers can automate their OS & Framework patching needs, maintaining secure environments, while adhering to the principals of immutable containers. ACR Build will dynamically discover base image dependencies, hooking base image update notifications from other ACR corporate registries, Docker Hub and other public registries coming in the future.

As a native container build service, the preview of ACR Build currently supports Linux and will support Windows as well as ARM based builds, supporting our Azure IoT initiative. ACR Build was designed as a container lifecycle primitive, that will extend and/or integrate into your CI/CD solution including Visual Studio Team Services, Jenkins, Brigade, with partners like Codefresh.io coming soon.

Inner-loop, extended to the cloud
The beginning of lifecycle management starts before developers check-in their first lines of code. ACR Build service enables an integrated local, inner-loop development experience, offloading builds to Azure. Developers can verify their automated build definitions, prior to checking in their code. Using the familiar docker build format, az acr build will take a local context, send it to the acr build service, optionally pushing to its registry upon completion. ACR Build will follow your geo-replicated registries, enabling dispersed development teams to leverage the closest datacenter enabled. For preview, ACR build service will support East US and West Europe.
