# ACR Build Preview information

## Announcements
We're happy to release Preview 2 which includes:

- build-task: a build definition that can be triggered on git commits, or run directly
- build-task logs: which lists the logs, their status and can connect to currently running build

## Things that are coming soon

- Base image updates: this was the main scenario we focus upon for ACR build. We'll have more on this soon. For background, you can read [OS & Framework Patching with Docker Containers â€“ a paradigm shift](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/stevelasker/2017/12/20/os-framework-patching-with-docker-containers-paradigm-shift/)
- Build Caching: we know this is the most painful part of ACR Build; waiting for image pulls and benefiting from interim image cache.
